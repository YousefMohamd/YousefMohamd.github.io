  <p style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.8;color:#b8b8b8;margin:28px 0 32px 0;">
    I am a Multidisciplinary Visual Artist with strong skills in Concept Art, Graphic Design, Animation, Editing, and VFX. My main focus is environment design and perspective drawing (up to 6-point). I combine traditional art basics with digital tools to create creative and clear visual ideas. I have experience in both personal projects and team collaborations, making storyboards, demo sequences, and design works. I am a fast learner, flexible, and problem solver, always improving my art and technical skills every day. I started academic learning and gained my practical experience from 2022 until now.
