My main focus is environment design and perspective drawing (up to 6-point). I combine traditional art basics with digital tools to create creative and clear visual ideas. I have experience in both personal projects and team collaborations, making storyboards, demo sequences, and design works. I am a fast learner, flexible, and problem solver, always improving my art and technical skills every day. I started academic learning and gained my practical experience from 2022 until now."
